# The Life


## The basic & raw form




---------------


## The very basic & raw form
- Possibly the very basic form of life is a single shell but, in general the very basic form can be understood as a tree or a plant basically
- When plant get decomposed, it produce a certain type of worm & the worm can further breed & go on for its lifecycle
- well this solves the problem egg first or chicken first
- then the next problem wheather plant first or seed first ?
- what is the very first plant ?
- Why plant & animal have similar lifecycle
they grow - create seed/egg - they die & the seed stores the gene
- both plant & animal / human have pipes/tubes like body structure ?
